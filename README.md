# EVAnalysisDashboard_Tableau
This Tableau project involves cleaning two combined CSV files, creating calculated fields and bins. The dashboard will feature KPIs for total vehicles, electric range, and BEV/PHEV metrics, plus charts analyzing distribution by year, state, make, and model. The final deliverable is an interactive dashboard with navigation and a data story.
